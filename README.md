The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Constitution does not require a jury in a criminal trial to consist of 12 members or to have a unanimous verdict in state criminal cases. However, The Constitution requires unanimity where only a 6-person jury is used. Williams v. Florida, 339 U.S. 78 (1970).

 Fourth Amendment:
The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. However, it generally does not apply to searches conducted by private individuals unless they are acting as agents or instruments of the government.

Private Search Doctrine:
If a private individual conducts a search without the government's involvement and later turns the evidence over to the government, the Fourth Amendment does not apply. However, if the government later encourages or participates in further searches, those subsequent searches may be subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny.

Issue: mere presence at the scene of a crime.
Issue: When does jeopardy attach? Jeopardy does not attach at a preliminary or at a grand jury proceeding. Jeopardy attaches in jury trial when the jury is sworn and in bench trial when the court begins to hear evidence.
Issue: Search incident to a lawful arrest is a well-established exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, allowing law enforcement officers to conduct a search without a warrant when it is related to a lawful arrest. The scope of this search is limited to certain areas and objects directly associated with the arrestee and the circumstances of the arrest.

What Can Be Searched:
1.	Person of the Arrestee:
o	The officer can search the arrestee’s body and clothing. This includes pockets, purses, wallets, and any containers or objects the arrestee is carrying at the time of arrest.
o	The purpose is to disarm the suspect and to preserve evidence that might be destroyed or hidden.
2.	Immediate Area Within the Arrestee's Control (Grabbable Area):
o	The officer can search the area within the immediate control of the arrestee, typically referred to as the "wingspan" or "grabbable area." This includes anything within the arrestee’s reach where they might access a weapon or destroy evidence.
o	For example, if the arrest occurs in a room, the police can search surfaces, drawers, or containers within the suspect’s immediate reach.
3.	Vehicle Search (When Arrest Occurs in or Near a Vehicle):
o	If the arrestee is in or immediately near a vehicle at the time of arrest, the police can search the passenger compartment of the vehicle and any containers within it (open or closed).
o	This rule was established in Arizona v. Gant (2009), where the U.S. Supreme Court held that police may search the vehicle incident to arrest only if the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search, or if it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.

4.	Search for Weapons and Evidence:
o	The primary justifications for this type of search are officer safety and the preservation of evidence. Therefore, officers can search for weapons that could be used against them or evidence that could be destroyed.
Limits on the Search:
•	Temporal and Spatial Limitations:
o	The search must be conducted contemporaneously with the arrest, meaning it must happen around the same time and in the same general location as the arrest.
o	The search cannot extend to distant areas or be conducted long after the arrest has occurred.
•	Containers within the Vehicle:
o	If the arrestee is secured (e.g., handcuffed in the back of a patrol car) and cannot access the vehicle, officers cannot search the vehicle unless they have reason to believe it contains evidence related to the crime for which the person was arrested.
Summary:
A search incident to a lawful arrest allows officers to search the person of the arrestee, the area within the arrestee’s immediate control, and in some cases, the passenger compartment of a vehicle. This search is justified by the need to protect officer safety and prevent the destruction of evidence and must be conducted contemporaneously with the arrest. The scope of the search is limited to areas and items that the arrestee might access or use during the arrest.

Accomplice Liability:
1.	Actus Reus (Conduct): The defendant must take some affirmative action to assist, encourage, or facilitate the commission of the crime.
2.	Mens Rea (Intent): The defendant must have the intent to assist in the commission of the crime.
Analysis:
•	Mere Presence (A): It is a general rule that merely being present at the scene of a crime, without more, does not make one an accomplice. This rule, however, has exceptions. If the person’s presence at the scene of the crime was intended to and did encourage the perpetrator, or if the person had a duty to act and failed to do so, then their presence can be enough to establish liability.
•	Specific Intent Crime (B): Murder is indeed a specific intent crime, requiring a specific intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. However, under the doctrine of accomplice liability, the accomplice must have the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime by another.
